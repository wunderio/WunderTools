(optional) WunderTools now supports having a custom repository for WunderTools
and build.sh (only on GitHub for now). To use it, create a fork of WunderTools
and/or build.sh, add your repo url and branches to conf/project.yml, here is an
example:

buildsh:
  enabled: true
  branch: develop
  repository: badrange/build.sh
  revision:
wundertools:
  repository: badrange/WunderTools
  branch: feature/custom-wundertools-repository

8
varnish.control_key variable added (optional). This will set up a Varnish control key in
/etc/varnish/secret and makes it a php environment variable for use in
vagrant.settings.php. Check vagrant.settings.php for Varnish 4 compatible
settings.

7
hash_behaviour changed to merge so that you don't need to copy the whole dict object from defaults when you just want to override some of the values in it.
To comply with this add "hash_behaviour=merge" to projects ansible.cfg file.

6
wkv_site_env variable is now required.

5
Varnish role has added parametrized probe url (probe_resource_url) that needs to be added to varnish configs or provisioning will fail.
This should usually point to _ping.php e.g. :  probe_resource_url: "_ping.php"
See ansible/playbook/roles/varnish/defaults/main.yml for reference.

4
Removed local_ansible_roles linking from wundertools. Make sure you have anisble.cfg in your repo root that defines roles_path like this:
roles_path=./local_ansible_roles:./ansible/playbook/roles

3
Centos7 branch is now the default (master) branch. If your project is still using centos6 update the ansible branch variable to "centos6" in the conf/project.yml or consider upgrading your project to use centos7.
For centos7 projects you should update the ansible branch to "master" as the centos7 branch will be deprecated and will not receive any updates in the future.

2
Possibility to use external repository for drupal. In that case you need to define following variables in conf/project.yml
externaldrupal:
  remote: [external drupal repository url]
  branch: [branch to use from the external repository]
Repository should have drupal installation directly under the repository root.

1
Added support for managed version updates for build.sh
